# OpenManus üôã

Manus is incredible, but OpenManus can achieve any ideas without an Invite Code üõ´!

Our team members [@mannaandpoem](https://github.com/mannaandpoem) [@XiangJinyu](https://github.com/XiangJinyu) [@MoshiQAQ](https://github.com/MoshiQAQ) [@didiforgithub](https://github.com/didiforgithub) from [@MetaGPT](https://github.com/geekan/MetaGPT) built it within 3 hours!

It's a simple implementation, so we welcome any suggestions, contributions, and feedback!

Enjoy your own agent with OpenManus!

OpenManus builds on GOD AI with a minimal core that talks to DeepSeek and
Telegram. It hunts for free cloud resources and records its daily activity in
`logs/angel_logs.txt`. The `SecretIBANTransfer` module can display a donation
IBAN whenever needed.

## Installation

1. Create a new conda environment:

```bash
conda create -n open_manus python=3.12
conda activate open_manus
```

2. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mannaandpoem/OpenManus.git
cd OpenManus
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Configuration

OpenManus requires configuration for the LLM APIs it uses. Follow these steps to set up your configuration:

1. Create a `config.toml` file in the `config` directory (you can copy from the example):

```bash
cp config/config.example.toml config/config.toml
```

2. Edit `config/config.toml` to add your API keys and customize settings:

```toml
# Global LLM configuration
[llm]
 zjbow5-codex/costruire-sistema-god-ai
model = "deepseek-coder"
base_url = "https://api.deepseek.com/v1"
api_key = "sk-..."  # Replace with your actual API key

 bc1kvb-codex/costruire-sistema-god-ai
model = "deepseek-coder"
base_url = "https://api.deepseek.com/v1"
api_key = "sk-..."  # Replace with your actual API key

model = "deepseek-coder"
base_url = "https://api.deepseek.com/v1"
api_key = "sk-..."  # Replace with your actual API key
 main
main
max_tokens = 4096
temperature = 0.0

# Optional configuration for specific LLM models
[llm.vision]
zjbow5-codex/costruire-sistema-god-ai
model = "deepseek-coder"
base_url = "https://api.deepseek.com/v1"
api_key = "sk-..."  # Replace with your actual API key

 bc1kvb-codex/costruire-sistema-god-ai
model = "deepseek-coder"
base_url = "https://api.deepseek.com/v1"
api_key = "sk-..."  # Replace with your actual API key

model = "deepseek-coder"
base_url = "https://api.deepseek.com/v1"
api_key = "sk-..."  # Replace with your actual API key

```

### GOD AI (Global Operating Developer)

GOD AI is a modular AGI framework optimized for Codex. It consists of a small
core that delegates tasks to **Arcangels**, each responsible for a functional
domain. Arcangels spawn new "angel" modules on demand so the system can grow
limitlessly while relying solely on free tools like DeepSeek and Telegram.

#### Quick launch

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and add `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`,
   `TELEGRAM_TOKEN` and `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` if you are running locally.
   **Never commit your real keys**. On Hugging Face Spaces, set them as
   repository secrets instead and `start.sh` will keep them intact.
2. Start the system with:

   The log file `logs/task_log.txt` records success or failure for each
   executed angel task.

```bash
bash start.sh
```
Mixtral is heavy, so if you need a GPU you can run the CLI. DeepSeek will be
used automatically if Mixtral fails:

```bash
python god_launcher.py
```

inside a free Google Colab and it will load the model automatically. You can
When running in Colab, use getpass to input your secrets securely:

```python
import getpass
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY = getpass.getpass("DeepSeek key: ")
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN = getpass.getpass("Telegram token: ")
TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID = getpass.getpass("Chat ID: ")
```

also execute `bash start.sh cli` to invoke the CLI through the same startup
script.

Angel scripts saved in `angels/` can be executed later using:

```bash
python angel_launcher.py
```

You can also pipe prompts from Manus by writing to `manus_input.txt` and
executing `python manus_connector.py`.
For a single-shot run that reads `manus_input.txt` and writes to
`manus_output.txt` you can use:

```bash
python god_ai_facile.py
```
On startup the system will send a message to your Telegram chat to confirm
activation.

The script automatically creates a `.env` file from `.env.example` on first
run and resolves any lingering Git merge markers in `README.md` or
`god_core.py`. All daily actions are recorded in `logs/angel_logs.txt` and the
system checks cloud connectivity every hour.

### Running on Google Colab

1. Clone the repository and install dependencies:

   ```bash
   !git clone https://github.com/mannaandpoem/OpenManus.git
   %cd OpenManus
   !pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Securely provide your secrets in the first notebook cell:

   ```python
   from getpass import getpass
   import os

   os.environ["DEEPSEEK_API_KEY"] = getpass("DeepSeek key: ")
   os.environ["TELEGRAM_TOKEN"] = getpass("Telegram token: ")
   os.environ["TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID"] = getpass("Chat ID: ")
   ```

3. Launch the command-line interface:

   ```bash
   !python god_launcher.py
   ```

The core loads Mixtral if a GPU is available and otherwise falls back to DeepSeek.

### Running on Hugging Face Spaces

If deploying to [Hugging Face Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces), set your
API keys as repository secrets (`DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`, `TELEGRAM_TOKEN`,
`TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID`). The `start.sh` script loads `.env` only for variables that
are not already defined, so your secrets remain in effect. Run `hf_space.py` as
the entry point. It launches a simple Gradio interface where
you can enter prompts and see responses from GOD AI.
The backend loads the Mixtral model via `transformers` if a GPU is available.
When no GPU is detected, it falls back to DeepSeek through its API.
